# Intro_To_Man_In_The_Middle_and_Rainbow_Table_Attacks
The final project for ENGI 3675.  We were seeing how Main in the Middle attacks and Rainbow tables worked as a group project.  We're build a minor ASP.NET connection to a PostgreSQL database, main in the middle it a hashed password that hasn't been HTTPS secured, then perform a Rainbow Table look up to find out what the password is.

Ignore the mistyped project name, it was left in place because we found it funny :P
